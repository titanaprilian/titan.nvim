# README Quality Checklist

Run before finalizing a new or rewritten README. Score each applicable item.

Scoring: Yes = 1, No = 0, N/A = exclude from denominator. Target: all applicable items pass.

## Structure (6 checks)

1. Title is the project name (not "About", "Introduction", or "Overview")
2. One-liner description appears directly below the title without a heading
3. Install section shows the single fastest path with a runnable command
4. Usage section includes at least one copy-pasteable, runnable example
5. Sections follow the order from the project-type template
6. Table of contents present if the README exceeds 100 lines

## Content (7 checks)

7. A new reader can install and run something within 60 seconds of reading
8. Every code block is copy-pasteable and runnable without modification
9. No placeholder text, TODO markers, Lorem ipsum, or `foo`/`bar`/`example` values
10. Description answers "what does this do" in one sentence
11. Install command includes the package manager and exact package name
12. Usage examples use realistic values and produce visible results
13. Requirements section lists minimum runtime version and system dependencies

## Writing (5 checks)

14. Active voice throughout ("Install the package" not "The package can be installed")
15. No "This project is..." or "This is a..." openers
16. Consistent terminology (one term per concept, same casing throughout)
17. No orphaned sections (every heading has content below it)
18. License section present with license name and link to LICENSE file

## Freshness (4 checks)

19. Badge versions match the actual published version (or badges are absent)
20. Install command uses the correct, currently published package name
21. Spot-check 2-3 links to confirm they are not broken
22. No references to deprecated APIs, removed features, or old package names

## Project-Type Specific

### CLI tools
- `--help` output matches the documented options
- Examples show real commands that produce expected output

### Libraries
- API section covers all public exports
- Import paths match the actual package structure

### Web apps
- Getting Started instructions produce a running app
- Environment variables table lists all required variables

### Monorepos
- Packages/workspaces table lists every workspace in the project
- Version badges (if present) are not stale — skip badges entirely for private monorepos
- Multi-runtime setup steps are documented (e.g., Python venv, Rust toolchain)

## Automatic Fail

Any of these means the README is not ready:

- No description (reader cannot tell what the project does)
- No install or getting started instructions (reader cannot use the project)
- Default boilerplate README (e.g., unchanged create-next-app template)
- Code examples that cannot run (syntax errors, missing imports, wrong API)
